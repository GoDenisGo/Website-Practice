# SmileyMouse

A mouse pointer is the most common tool that desktop users will use to interact 
with their computer. Smiley Mouse is a small website and web-server package that
changes the shape of the mouse pointer. This package is a demonstration of some 
basic web development knowledge and serves as practice for myself.

## Features

- Custom cursor applied when pointing device enters the viewport

The website offers other features that were not relevant to this package:
- Flexbox display to split the articles over the same line.
- Hovering the articles using a pointer will change the background colour
of the articles.
- All text is written in a dyslexic-friendly font (Arial).
- The content will dynamically resize and even wrap to the next line as
the viewport shrinks, in order to support different screen sizes.
- CSS Media queries are applied in order to make the website more
accessible on touchscreen devices.
